		<p>Artist's Rendition of me</p>
		<p>Hi! My name is Jorge Anzaldo. I'm a senior in high school taking this course for dual credit. I've tried to learn HTML in the past, but never got very serious with it.</p>
		<p>But hey, I've already made it to the first project, so I think that's a good sign!</p>
		<p>When I'm not doing work for high school or college classes, I'm either hanging out with my friends (online, since COVID happened), trying to learn game design (Unreal Engine 4) or editiing together a YouTube video (more on that on page 3).</p>
